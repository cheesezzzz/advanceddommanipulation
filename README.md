# advanceddommanipulation

A project that I created along on a Udemy course. The code I've written are mainly Javascript while the HTML and CSS are already prewritten by the course instructor. 

I have learned quite a few things in this project in regards to DOM manipulation:


- Types of Events and Event Handlers
- How to create, select or delete elements using JS
- Event Propagation: Capturing and Bubbling 
- Dom Traversing 
- Adding Styles, Attributes and Classes using JS
- Intersection Observer API
